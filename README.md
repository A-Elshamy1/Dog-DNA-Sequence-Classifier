Dog DNA Sequence Classifier
Overview
This Jupyter notebook analyzes a dataset of dog DNA sequences labeled with classes. The goal is to explore the data, perform preprocessing, and eventually build a classifier to predict the class of a DNA sequence based on its features.

Dataset
The dataset (dog_data.txt) contains 820 entries, each with:

A DNA sequence (sequence).

A corresponding class label (class).
